## Hello there 👋

For my grade XII school project, I made this system to book airline tickets in Python programming language. Just be aware that some flight names have already been entered into this project, and that it does not actually book tickets for flights. In addition, I'd like to warn you that the code is poorly organised and messy, so you might have trouble understanding it.

***Wishing you luck 👍***

## <ins>INSTRUCTIONS FOR YOU RELATED TO PROPER WORKING OF THE CODE</ins>

👉 Save both the icon files (icon.ico and icon.png) in your destop folder.

👉 Make sure you copy the location of the icon files and paste it in the code wherever required else you may see errors on executing the code.

👉 Anything written between the two # tags in the code is the instruction(s) for you. Read the instruction and then replace the line of the code as the given instruction.

👉 There is a separate file (CreateTable.sql) in this repository to create tables for storing user/customer data in this project. You may run the file in command prompt (CMD in short) or in MySQL Workbench to create tables. This is completely optional, even if you don't run this file, tables will however be created when you run the main file (FlightTicketBookingSystem.py).

👉 At the end of the ticket booking process, the system wil send the user an email with all of his/her details. Therefore, you need to create a google account to send the email and disable the gmail's SMTP settings, check online how to do so.
>I created a new google account to send emails, you may do the same and delete the account when you're done with your project
